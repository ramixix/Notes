## What is the Registry?
If you remember back to DOS and early versions of Windows(3.1,3.11 and so on ), configuration information (drivers, settings) for the system was largely managed by several files-specifically, autoexec.bat, config.sys, win.ini (on windows)and system.ini. 

Various settings within these files determined what programs were loaded and how the system looked and responded to user input, Later versions of windows replaced these files with the Registry, a central hierarchical database that maintains configuration settings for the application, hardware devices, and users.
