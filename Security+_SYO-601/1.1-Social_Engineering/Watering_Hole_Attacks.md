# Watering Hole Attacks
An organization that is very secure creates a problem for attackers. They're trying to infect the systems that are inside of your network, but if you have a high level of security and high level of information about social attacks the attackers can not do so much. So the attackers change their strategy instead of going directly to you, they're going to go to a third party and hopefully you'll visit the third party and become infected.

**This third party is the Watering Hole. It's the central place where they are hoping users inside of your organization are going to come and take a drink (like in the wild).** 

Once they infect the watering hole, your users visit that website, become infected themselves and now the attackers have a way into your network.

### Executing the watering hole attack
This usually takes a bit of research on the part of the attackers, they need to find out where your users are visiting (ex: they might infect a local coffee or sandwich shop website, or it could be an Industry-related sites that your organization often visits.)

The attackers then focus their efforts on trying to find a vulnerability on this third-party site. The attacker is trying to direct their attack towards a particular group of organization but often they have to put malware on a site that will affect everyone who visits that site and what they are hoping is that you will be part of that larger group that visits and becomes infected by visiting the site.

### How to prevent Watering hole attacks 
There are ways to help prevent a watering hole attack. One of the thing you can do is to make sure that all of your systems are very well secured. And it is not just using one particular type of security defense , you need layered defense or something we call defense in depth.

You might also considering a next-generation firewall or intrusion prevention system that is able to look for these types of attacks or this type of malicious software and stop it before it gets onto your systems.
