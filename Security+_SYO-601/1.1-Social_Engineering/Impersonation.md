# Impersonation
![impersonation](../images/Impersonation.jpeg)
All of the good attackers are very good at impersonation. This usually starts with a pretext which is simply a lie that sets up the entire scenario for the particular attack. There is usually an actor(the attacker itself most of times) who is trying to gain access or get information from you and there is very often a story.

Here is some an actual attack that were used and the pretext that were used during the attack itself :
>"Hello sir, my name is Wendy and I'm from Microsoft Windows. This is an urgent check up call for you computer as we have found several problems with it."

Obviously they're not calling from Microsoft Windows and Wendy is not a  representative of Microsoft. This is someone who is trying to either gain access to your computer to convince you there is something wrong with it and to pay them to fix it or to gain access to your computer so that it can then participate in a botnet.

### what Strategies do the attackers use? 
- **In each of these situations, that attacker is trying to pretend to be someone they are not and this is called Impersonation.**
- very often the attacker picks the person to impersonate based on some reconnaissance that they've done of you or your organization. They commonly know your name, they know the organization that you work for, they know that there is a help desk, they might even know the city and state that the help desk happens to be in.
- Very often they impersonate as someone who is higher in rank that you(victim).
- Attackers try to throw tons of technical details around and this way the attacker can try to confuse the person who's on the other end of the phone or etc.
- Maybe they just act very friendly to show that of course they're from this(your) organization and they might even mention things that are occurring in the local area to make you feel comfortable with who you're talking to.

Once attacker has the victim at ease they can start extracting information very easily from that person.** This is called Eliciting information**. 
This commonly done with voice phishing or vishing where someone performing this attack over the phone. The attackers use psychological techniques to be able to put people at ease and gather this information from the end user.

### How protect against impersonation?
- you must be very protective of your personal information and never volunteer anything to anyone who might be calling you. No one s ever going to ask you for a password because that information is not required to be able to perform technical support services.
- You also don't want to give someone personal details or more information about you that normally they would not have ( they can used it for **identity fraud** situations,for ex: credit card fraud, bank fraud, loan fraud, government benefits fraud ...)
- It's very useful if you can verify the person who is calling you. (let me hang up  I'll check the number and I'll call you back directly and we'll make sure that you are the person who you say you are).
