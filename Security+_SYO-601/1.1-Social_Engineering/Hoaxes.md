# Hoaxes
**In the world of IT security a hoax is a situation that seems like it could be real but in reality, it's not real at all. A thread that doesn't actually exist**

This is something that can be in many different shapes, from an email to a message on your screen, to a voice mail that you might receive. And even though these situations aren't real they still use a lot of your time, a lot of your energy, a lot of your resources .

One of the challenges with stopping a hoax is you're never quite sure how it's going to manifest itself. It might be something on Facebook, might be email message that you receive, might be something that pops up in your browser.

Many of the current hoaxes tend to get money from you but they tent to do it by making you purchase gift cards.

We still sometimes even see hoaxes associated with viruses or with malware that aren't actually viruses or malware on your system. They're just making themselves look as if you are infected with this particular type of malware.
