# Phishing
Attackers try to gather some type of personal information from target victim by making them click on some links. So **phishing is generally a bit of social engineering combined with spoofing.**
- Often delivered by email, text, etc.
- Very remarkable when well done.

links and website are so legit that you might not realize that is fake. **The one thing that the attacker can't do is make the address bar show the actual URL or the legitimate website.**
- Check the URL
- Sometimes other aspects like Spelling, fonts, graphics might not seems quite right either so check them too.

The attacker try to use many different tricks to get victims to click these links and input their personal information into these pages. they making the pages look very common and similar to what others expect. They also try to present to victims a domain name in the address bar that looks very similar to what others are expecting for instance you might find a bad guy using typosquatting (misspelling very close to actual word), which is a type of URL hijacking. for example **www.gougle.com** almost looks like it's legitimate, except g-o-o-g-l-e is spelled g-o-u-g-l-e. They also commonly prepend to the address ex. www.ggoogle.com.
#### typosquatting
- A type of URL hijacking - http://www.gougle..com
- Prepending - http://ggoogle.com

We often see these emails being send to individuals and the attackers are trying to gather this information one person at a time until they have all of the information they need. *But There are times when the attacker might want to attack an entire group of people simultaneously * **This is called Pharming.** It's usually created when the attacker is able to take over an entire domain name system server or be able to take over an entire website so that everybody who visited the DNS server or visited the website will be automatically directed to the attacker's website.

This means that you could be typing in the correct address in your browser but because the DNS has been poisoned, now you're at the attakcer's website, and you would simply put in your user credentials because it looks like the normal website. So now there are tow different kinds of attacks in place, the pharming is redirecting everybody who visits that DNS server to the attacker's website, and then the phishing takes place once they arrive there, as they are putting in their email address, username, password and other personal information.
- Pharming - harvest large groups of people.
- Phishing - Collect access credential.

##### Phishing with different bait
The attackers have moved to the telephone as a way to gather your personal information. **Performing this attack over a voice line is called Vishing (for voice phishing).**
Very often, the attacker is spoofing the phone number that is appearing on the incoming call, so it looks like it's a local phone number, But in reality they could be calling from anywhere. The point of the phone call or the voicemail that they leave ultimately leads to you giving up some type of personal information that they can use to gain access to your accounts.

Of course they may not even need to talk to you, they can do everything over** SMS(Short Message Service) text messages. This is also referred to as Smishing or SMS Phishing.** Often these text messages have a link and the attacker tries to entice you into clicking that link and providing them with more information.

There are many many different ways that attackers try to entice you to give up your information or your money. Many of these scams can be found in a large list on Reddit, you can find it at [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams).

With some of these attacks, the attacker isn't after an email password. They are instead trying to get large sums of money transferred into their personal account. To be able to do that, they need to gather as much information as possible on the victim. So they'll perform as number of different steps of reconnaissance prior to performing the actual phishing attack.

It's remarkable how much open source information is available on the internet and you can gather information about individuals, groups of individuals or large organizations by simply visiting third party websites, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram and other locations. Based on information they gathered they can create a very believable pretext. They might be able to determine where you live, where you work, who you work with, be able to use people's names, be able to understand places that you shop and put all of that information into a very believable phishing attack.

**This types of very directed phishing attacks are called Spear Phishing attacks.** They are going after very specific person or very specific group of people to be able to gather the information that they need. **A spear phishing attack that goes after a person who has control of a lot of money or a lot of information is calling Whaling.** It's very common to go after the CEO or head of the accounting department because they have access to the entire corporate bank account. All you need is one very well-crafted phishing attack to be able to convince somebody to log into a fake user account that would then provide the attacker with all of the banking information for the organization.
