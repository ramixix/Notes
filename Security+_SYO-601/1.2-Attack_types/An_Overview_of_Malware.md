# An Overview of Malware
## Malware
**Malware is malicious software. It is software that is going to do something that will probably have a negative impact on you.**

Very often malware will be set up to gather information from you machine. It will collect keystrokes, it will collect information that is on your screen and it will send that information off to the attacker.

There is also malware that would cause your computer to be controlled by a third party.This is software that would turn your computer into a bot and it would participate with a much larger group of computers called a botnet. There would then be a third party (the attacker) who would be able to control all of those systems and have those  computers participate in a denial of service attack, visit different websites, or do what ever they would like your computer to do,  because they have installed that malware on your system.

There is also malware that might show advertisements on your computer and on every advertisement some money goes back to the malware owner. If they can distribute this to a million different computers, then they can make quite a lot of money by simply adding malware to your system for advertising.

And some of the worst malware these days is malware that might encrypt all of your private files on your computer and require you to pay to get the decryption key from the attacker

## How you get malware 
Malware can find itself onto our systems in many different ways and once the malware begins the process of installing itself it can use other types of malware to install other types of software on your computer.

The malware authors might send you an email hat looks legitimate and looks like it is something you should be clicking, but instead it is going to download and install malware all because you click the link that is in that email.

Malware authors will also use websites to embed their links and have pop-up messages to entice you to click those links and download the software so that they can then run that malware on your local computer.

They might also use these web pages to automatically download software to your computer and then encourage you to run that software using a technique called a drive-by download.

And if the operating system happens to have a vulnerability that might exploited by a worm, this would be a common way to have malware installed onto your system. That is why it is so important to always maintain the latest security updates on your computer. Vulnerabilities can also be found within the applications that run in your operating system, So make sure that you update not only the OS but all of the applications running on that operating system as well.
