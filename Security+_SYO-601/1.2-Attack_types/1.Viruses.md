# Viruses
**A virus is malware that can reproduce itself, but one of the unique characteristics of a virus is that it needs you (the end user) to click on or launch that application to start the virus replication process.**

This is something that differentiates a virus from [[2.Worms]]. The virus needs a human being to start the process, whereas a worm can jump from machine to machine without any human intervention whatsoever. 

Once the end user has launched the executable that starts the virus, it can sue the existing file-system or the network to replicate itself. What happens next depends on the virus itself. Some viruses are very malicious for example they can delete files, can encrypt your data and can cause some serious problems on your computer whereas other viruses maybe relatively benign(kind and gentle!), they may simply put advertising on your screen or they may be simply gathering information from your computer and you probably have no idea the virus is even installed.

## Virus types
We tend to put viruses into different categories, one of the most common virus types is a program virus whereas the virus is part of an application that is running and you clicking on that application or launching that application is what causes the virus to execute on your system.

A relatively rare virus these days i a boot sector virus. This is a virus that exists in the boot sector of your storage device and when you start your computer the virus itself is launched. All you have to do is start the operating system and the virus is tarted along with the boot sector.

Some viruses operate as scripts on your system. They may operate as a script in the operating system or they might be a script that runs inside of your browser.

Another types of virus that is very similar to a script virus is a macro virus. A macro virus is usually running inside of another application These are commonly associated with Microsoft Office apps.

## File-less Virus
**A newer style of virus is a fileless virus. It is a virus that never installs itself or saves itself as file on your file system.** This is a method that the virus uses to try to avoid some of the techniques that the antivirus software uses, especially if the antivirus software is looking at what you save to storage device. If the virus is never saving itself to the storage drive, then it may be able to evade the antivirus software.

**Instead of existing as a file that might execute, the fileless operate solely(only) in the memory of computer. Once it is started all of the operations happen inside of RAM and nothing is ever written to the storage drive on your system.**

A common way to execute a fileless virus is to click a link on a website or click a link that is inside of an email. This will then download software that will run as a flash file, a java file or perhaps it takes advantages of a windows vulnerability to begin executing. These vulnerabilities in flash or java or windows might allow a script to be run in Power-Shell for example. Power-Shell would then download the virus from  a third-party website and then executes that virus in the memory of your local computer. Once this virus is executing in the memory of your system it can encrypt files, it can delete information, it can exfiltrate data and do anything else that you as an end user may have access to run on that computer. And since the virus writers would like to have this fileless virus execute again later, they might even change registry so that this entire process can start itself all over again every time you boot your computer.
